            thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the

            regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim
            about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul;
            whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin
            warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and
            especially whenever my
            <span data-ig-kind="dict" data-ig-key="hypo">hypos</span> get such
            an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to
            prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and
            methodically knocking people’s hats off⁠—then, I account it high
            time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for

            mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their
            hillside blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though
            this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this
            shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were
            fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in

            robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time

            Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I
            begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of
            my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as
            a passenger. For to go as a passenger you
            <span data-ig-kind="dict" data-ig-key="must-needs">must needs</span>
            have a purse, and a purse is but a
            <span data-ig-kind="dict" data-ig-key="rag">rag</span> unless you
            have something in it. Besides, passengers get seasick⁠—grow
            quarrelsome⁠—don’t sleep of nights⁠—do not enjoy themselves much, as
            a general thing;⁠—no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am
            something of a
            <span data-ig-kind="dict" data-ig-key="salt">salt</span>, do I ever
            go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the
            glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my
            part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and
            tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can
            do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques,
            brigs, schooners, and whatnot. And as for going as cook⁠—though I
            confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of
            officer on shipboard⁠—yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling
            <span data-ig-kind="dict" data-ig-key="fowl">fowls</span>;⁠—though
            once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and
            peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to
            say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the
            idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled
            <span data-ig-kind="dict" data-ig-key="ibis">ibis</span> and roasted
            <span data-ig-kind="dict" data-ig-key="river-horse"

            >, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge
            bake-houses the pyramids.
          </p>
          <p>
            No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the
            mast, plumb down into the forecastle,
            <span data-ig-kind="dict" data-ig-key="aloft">aloft</span> there to
            the royal masthead. True, they rather order me about some, and make
            me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And
            at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s
            sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established
            family in the land, the
            <span data-ig-kind="reference" data-ig-key="van-rensselaers"
              >Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes</span
            >. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the
            <span data-ig-kind="dict" data-ig-key="tar">tar-pot</span>, you have
            been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys
            stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you,
            from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of
            <span data-ig-kind="reference" data-ig-key="seneca-and-the-stoics"
              >Seneca and the Stoics</span
            >
            to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time.
          </p>
          <p>
            What of it, if some old
            <span data-ig-kind="dict" data-ig-key="hunks">hunks</span> of a
            sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? What
            does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the
            New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything
            the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old
            <span data-ig-kind="dict" data-ig-key="hunks">hunks</span> in that
            particular instance? Who ain’t a slave? Tell me that. Well, then,
            however the old sea-captains may order me about⁠—however they may
            thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it
            is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much
            the same way⁠—either in a physical or metaphysical point of view,
            that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands
            should rub each other’s shoulder-blades, and be content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of
            paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single
            penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves
            must pay. And there is all the difference in the world between
            paying and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most
            uncomfortable infliction that
            <span data-ig-kind="reference" data-ig-key="orchard-thieves"
              >the two orchard thieves</span
            >
            entailed upon us. But <em>being paid</em>⁠—what will compare with
            it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really
            marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the
            root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man
            enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome
            exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck. For as in this world,
            head winds are far more prevalent than winds from
            <span data-ig-kind="dict" data-ig-key="astern">astern</span> (that
            is, if you never violate
            <span data-ig-kind="reference" data-ig-key="pythagorean-maxim"
              >the Pythagorean maxim</span
            >), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarterdeck gets his
            atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He
            thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same way do the
            commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same time
            that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after
            having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now
            take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible
            police officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of
            me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable
            way⁠—he can better answer than anyone else. And, doubtless, my going
            on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of
            Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort
            of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I
            take it that this part of the bill must have run something like
            this:

          <p>
            Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers,
            the Fates, put me down for this shabby
            <span data-ig-kind="dict" data-ig-key="part">part</span> of a
            whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in
            high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and
            jolly parts in farces⁠—though I cannot tell why this was exactly;
            yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a
            little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented
            to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing
            the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a
            choice resulting from my own unbiased free-will and discriminating
            judgment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great
            whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all
            my curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his
            island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these,
            with all the attending marvels of a thousand
            <span data-ig-kind="dict" data-ig-key="patagonia">Patagonian</span>
            sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With other men,
            perhaps, such things would not have been inducements; but as for me,
            I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to
            sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what
            is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social
            with it⁠—would they let me⁠—since it is but well to be on friendly
            terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.
          </p>
          <p>
            By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the
            great floodgates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild
            conceits that swayed me to my purpose,
            <span data-ig-kind="reference" data-ig-key="two-and-two"
              >two and two</span
            >
            there floated into my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale,
            and, mid most of them all,
            <span
              data-ig-kind="reference"
